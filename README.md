# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2021 ðŸŽ„
I plan on particpating in AoC 2022. This repository will host my warmup files from 2021 to warmup. I plan on using Lua for 2022, so I'm going to use Lua for 2021 as well as warmups.

I will be attempting this year's challenges in Python.
- I did the first two in Lua, that was a mistake.
