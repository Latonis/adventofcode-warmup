# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2021 ðŸŽ„
I plan on particpating in AoC 2022. This repository will host my warmup files from 2021 to warmup. I plan on using Lua for 2022, so I'm going to use Lua for 2021 as well as warmups.

I will be attempting this year's challenges in [Lua](https://www.lua.org/).
- There's no particular reason for Lua. I've never used it before other than my warmup for this year's Advent of Code.
